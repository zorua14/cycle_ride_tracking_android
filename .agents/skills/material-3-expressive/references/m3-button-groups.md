- Standard and connected button group tokens are organized by size. Select the variant and size from the token set menu. Go to the button and icon button pages to view their tokens. Learn about design tokens
- Button groups are invisible containers that add padding between buttons and modify button shape. They don't contain any buttons by default.
- Common layouts Mix and match buttons and icon buttons for different scenarios.
- Color Button groups have no color properties. They can use the default button or toggle button color styles, like filled, tonal, and outlined. Avoid using standard icon buttons or text buttons, as they have no container treatment.
- Selection & activation
- Standard button groups add interaction between adjacent buttons when a button is selected or activated. This interaction changes the width, shape, and padding of the selected or activated button, which adjusts the width of buttons directly next to it.
- Connected button groups don't add any interaction between buttons when selected or activated. They only affect the shape of the button being selected or activated.
- Standard button group
- When a button is pressed, standard button groups modify the width and shape of that button and adjacent buttons.
- When a toggle button is selected in a standard button group , its shape should change between square and round. The color should change according to the button specs .
- Connected button group
- Connected button groups have different shape changes than standard button groups. Selecting a button does not affect adjacent buttons.
- Standard groups apply padding between all buttons. The amount of padding changes based on button size to ensure a minimum accessible target size of 48dp. More details on padding: Button specs , icon button specs
- For all connected button groups, use 2dp padding. This provides visual consistency at scale.
- Extra small and small connected button groups have 48dp target areas and a minimum width of 48dp.
- High contrast mode
- High contrast mode is an accessibility feature that aims to maximize legibility by using a limited color palette. Follow the contrast mode set by the buttons. For selection, use white.
- The selected button changes shape and width
- A selected toggle button also changes color
- Adjacent buttons move and temporarily change width
- Only use multiple sizes in a group for hero moments
- Avoid mixing sizes frequently
- Only use a different shape in a group when a button is selected, or to add meaning or contrast
- Connected button groups help people select options, switch views, or sort elements in a page. They behave similarly to standard groups, except they don't affect adjacent buttons. Connected groups should replace the baseline segmented button, which is no longer recommended.
- Use connected button groups when the button content is related, and buttons can be selected.
- Connected button groups should be used for single or multi-select patterns that use toggle buttons. Avoid using a connected group when none of the buttons can be toggled.
- Color Avoid mixing color styles in connected button groups; it can make selection and emphasis unclear.
- Container The standard button group container has padding between buttons so they can animate width and shape without disrupting the product layout. The standard button group hugs the width of the buttons inside.
- The connected button group should span the width of the page or surface it's placed on, increasing the button widths inside. In larger windows, consider adding a maximum width to the connected group to avoid it growing too wide.
- Fixed : Manually define the button width (narrow to wide), size (XS to XL), or padding at each breakpoint.
- Flexible : Automatically increase or decrease the width of buttons and the button group. Button groups grow until all flexible buttons are at their largest width.
- In compact windows, consider using smaller, narrower buttons so all buttons in the button group can fit. In large and extra large windows, consider using larger, wider buttons to better fill in the available space. Flexible buttons or button groups will automatically adjust width.
- When scaling to larger breakpoints, make sure that the visual hierarchy of each button is preserved using qualities like color and size. For example, the primary action should remain the largest, widest, or most visually prominent button at all breakpoints.
- Presentation Buttons at the trailing edge of the button group can be customized to collapse into an overflow menu at smaller breakpoints, and become visible again at larger sizes. Place the overflow menu at the trailing end of the group. Buttons outside the group aren't affected by button group behavior.
- Pressed When a button is pressed, it changes width and shape. In a standard button group, pressing a button also affects the width of adjacent buttons. In a connected button group, only the shape of the pressed button changes.
- Selected A selected button should change shape from round to square, or square to round.
- Navigate to and interact with each button in the group
- Identify when buttons are selected
- Interaction & style Each button in a group should have a minimum 48x48dp target. Extra small and small button groups have larger inner padding to ensure accessible targets. Avoid reducing the padding in these sizes.
- Initial focus The button group container is not a focusable element. Initial focus should land on the first button in the group and then move to each button.
- Use Tab to navigate through each item in the group, and Space or Enter to select buttons.
- Keyboard navigation Keys Actions Tab Navigates to the next button Space or Enter Activates the focused button
- Labeling elements The button group container does not need to be labeled. Label each button according to the button and icon button accessibility guidance.
