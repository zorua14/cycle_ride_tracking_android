- Color Color values are implemented through design tokens. For design, this means working with color values that correspond with tokens. In implementation, a color value will be a token that references a value. Learn more about design tokens
- Color styles FABs can use several combinations of color and on-color styles, such as primary and on-primary . The following color mappings provide the same legibility and functionality, so the color mapping you use depends on style alone.
- Baseline color styles
- Surface FAB color styles are still available, but no longer recommended.
- States States are visual representations used to communicate the status of a component or interactive element. When using a non-default color mapping for FABs, make sure the state layer color is the same as the icon color. For example, the state layer color for the primary color style should be md.sys.color.primary .
- Use the table's menu to select a token set. This only includes tokens for small and surface FABs, which are both no longer recommended. It doesn't include other colors, or large or regular FABs, since those are still currently used.
- Use a FAB for the most important action on a screen; it appears in front of all other content. The FAB can be aligned left, center, or right. It can be positioned above the navigation bar, or nested within it.
- Medium FAB (most recommended)
- The FAB is the smallest size, and is best used in compact windows where other actions may be present on screen. The medium FAB is recommended for most situations, and works best in compact and medium windows. Use it for important actions without taking up too much space. A large FAB is useful in any window size when the layout calls for a clear and prominent primary action, but is best suited for expanded and larger breakpoints, where its size helps draw attention.
- Start a process
- Archive or trash
- Alerts or errors
- Limited tasks like cutting text
- Controls better suited to a toolbar, like to adjust volume or font color
- Container The FAB is typically displayed in a square container. The container shouldn't be covered by other elements, such as badges. The container must have sufficient color contrast with the surface it's placed on.
- Icon An icon in a FAB should be clear and understandable. When hovering over a FAB on web products, FABs should display a tooltip with an accompanying icon text label. Use a filled icon instead of an outlined icon. A FAB shouldn't contain notifications or actions found elsewhere on a screen.
- In compact and medium breakpoints, the best place for the FAB is typically the lower right corner of a screen, since it's easy to reach and is less likely to cover important content. In expanded breakpoints, consider placing the FAB in the upper left corner, like in the navigation rail. This positions it as one of the first interactive elements people see when they land on the page. Adjust the size of the FAB based on the context. Use a medium FAB for mobile layouts, and large FAB for tablets and large screens.
- Appearing When a FAB animates on screen, it expands outward from a central point. The icon within it can be animated as well. While FABs should be relevant to screen content, they aren't attached to the surface on which content appears. FABs move separately from other UI elements because of their relative importance. Screen transitions FABs can morph to launch related actions. When a screen changes its layout, the FAB should disappear and reappear during the transition. Reappearance The FAB should only reappear if it's relevant to the new screen. It should reappear in the same position, if possible.
- Scrolling FABs remain in place on scroll. Extended FABs can collapse into a FAB on scroll and expand on reaching the bottom of the view.
- Moving across tabs When tabs are present, the FAB should briefly disappear, then reappear when the new content moves into place. This shows that the FAB is not connected to any particular tab.
- Don't animate the FAB with body content.
- Navigate to and activate the FAB
- Perform an action with the FAB
- Expand and minimize an extended FAB
- Interaction & style
- Don't disable the FAB. If the action represented in the FAB is unavailable, the FAB shouldn't appear. Ensure the icon has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio with the container.
- Ensure the FAB is prioritized in the overall focus order to create an efficient experience for people who navigate UIs with assistive tech. On mobile, the focus order may start with the app bar, move to the navigation bar, and then skip past any other content on the page to land on the FAB. Consider displaying a tooltip when the FAB is focused. This is supported on web.
- Layout & position
- To make it easier for users of screen readers to reach a primary action such as a FAB on expanded breakpoints, consider placing the FAB in the upper left region. However, it's critical to test placement options with users to see if the upper left region is the best position in all browser windows. For compact and medium breakpoints, the best place for the FAB is the lower right corner of a screen.
- To ensure accessibility for keyboard users on the web, avoid positioning the FAB in a way that completely obscures the focus indicator of an actionable element. It's okay to partially cover the desired element, as long as the focus indicators are still visible.
- Keys Actions Tab Focus lands on the FAB Space or Enter Perform the default action on an item
- The accessibility label should describe the action that the button is performing, such as Compose a new message .
